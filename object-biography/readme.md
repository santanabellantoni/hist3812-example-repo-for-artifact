# Object Biography

The object I chose to make a 3D model of a vintage folding camera. The maker of the camera is Kodak. 

The model is a 130mm Kodak Anastigmat No. 1A Kodak Junior , approximately made in the 1920s.

Looking through ebay the price of the lens alone is around $30.

I found a very similar camera on ebay for roughly around $108 CAD. Less expensive than I had originally thought it would be worth.

The model I have is a little worn in, some of he leather has broken off. The back portion of the camera pops off to put in the film.

Inside it has all the patent dates in the USA, Canada and Australia. The particular model I have was made in Toronto, Ontario, Canada.

There is no view finder to see what you are taking a photo of.
