Critical Making in Digital History
 
	•	What does history look like?
	•	What does digital history look like?
	•	Materiality of history 
	•	Document the process and reflect
	•	"making" vs. "hacking"
	•	It's as if hacking has been sanitized and transformed into 'making' - with politics, activism, tactics, history, economics and social issues removed in the process
	•	Translating from physical to digital

“If we stop interpreting, if we stop rehearsing, if we stop reproducing, the very existence of the original is at stake. It might stop having abundant copies and slowly disappear.” 
-what about those people who cannot visit Paris every day to visit the Louvre?
-what about authenticity? Who is looking for authenticity?
-collective memory
-but without these copies, would we value the original as much?
What does originality mean?
“The original although only in the name”
The value of replications..
Why are these objects replicated? 
The “secondary”


Which one is the reproduction?^
Which one is more valuable?
Botched Restoration of Jesus Fresco Miraculously Saves Spanish Town
Subjectivity, reproductions with small defects are worth more than the original(ex: star wars figures, rare coins, stamps, defect bank notes)
Mechanical reproduction of art gives more access to the masses. Original vs. cheap reproduction. An artist’s intention of their piece loses meaning as time goes on. The audience may perceive the piece of art entirely different than the artist or fellow audience members.  
Censorship in restoring original paintings. 
The public is an examiner, but an absent-minded one.
Objects have a use biography - used and represented different ways throughout its life.

ACCORD PROJECT
+Thoughts on the heritage of the project:
 
-How the process changed to the final product. (What they thought/planned vs what came out)
 
- Effect of the object on audience interpretation vs how the creators intended it. 
 
Process vs. product - intangible vs. tangible
 
-how much of the process does the audience need to know about to create the “proper” context for appreciating the product?
 
In the process of creating something, does it change the story of the object? And are you indirectly changing the story? How can the change of context or environment change the object and its perceived meaning? 
 
Divorcing an object from its context 
 
Why are we reproducing something?
 
How did the community interact and how did it change them? 
 
Stated that they weren’t ready to take the most professional and objective picture. Acknowledge own limits. Value was in the process of creating the object and connecting with its heritage. 
 
Aura - cult of originality for so long, but there was a time when the copy was what was valued (plaster casts of ancient architecture) - where is the aura in both? 
	•	Now movement towards valuing the original object without context (simply because it’s the original)
	•	Preserving the form but not the material - sometimes the material is just important as the form - the material can inform the form and have its own connotations 
 
Context of production, display, materials
	•	Can be political - will see this later 
 
Idea of performance
 
Artistic value vs. historical value
	•	Artistic - its ability to inspire future work, change doesn’t diminish the object’s value
	•	Does intent behind the creation of the model influence the end value in some way? From a artistic or a historic perspective. 
	•	Is historical value performed as well as artistic value?
 
Continually remaking an object for the needs of the present
 
In digitizing things do we lose the sense of the tangible - does it lose meaning?
	•	Google Maps/Earth - captures a moment in time (weird temporality) 
	•	Google Earth Project on residential schools in Canada - showing the schools and their role https://earth.google.com/web/@43.127456,-80.240846,200.63860771a,4500000d,35y,0h,45t,0r/data=CmYSZBIgYTBlNWFkNDVhMjBiMTFlN2IzZmQzZjBhY2YwNDZiOWEaHkNhbmFkYeKAmXMgUmVzaWRlbnRpYWwgU2Nob29scyIgZWZlZWRfcmNnc19yZXNpZGVudGlhbF9zY2hvb2xzXzA 
 
Do you have to go to a place to find meaning with it?
	•	What insights a feeling of connection to a digital thing? (changes meaning of the thing)
 
Think about aura, meaning, trust, authenticity of anything that gets digitized 
	•	What does digitizing do to the history?
 
Top Tips of 3D Models
 
	•	Using computers is easier than your phone
	◦	Underhill computers or Regard 3D (at home)
	•	There are more settings you can play with when using the computer
 
	•	Make sure to get rid of the background of your pictures  (photo-masking)
	◦	Use paint and erase background
	◦	Gimp is a free ”photoshop” that will allow you to remove the background 
	•	Trace with a select tool and then inverse(ctl i), and delete
	◦	The cleaner your image, the better your model
 
	•	Use highest resolution image possible 
	◦	Work with it and see what you can do, the more work you can get done in Regard3D is less 
work for you when it comes to editing.
 
	•	Great lighting
 
	•	30-50 pictures and angle is important
 
	•	DON’T feel discouraged the first time you do it because it probably won’t work (but that’s okay!!)
 
	•	Watch Tutorials
 
	•	Possibility: try taking video and taking stills from video (youtube-dl, ffmepg, exiftool)
 
	•	Work is parts, it helps prevent breakage. Take picture of certain parts then put it together during the final stages. 
 
3D modelling applications
-Gimp
-vectr
-photoshop (there are tutorials on how to get all adobe applications for free just google it)
- MS paint
-SketchUp (no download needed for the free version)
-exiftool (to add focal length for pictures taken on phone camera apps)

Uploading Your File to Github 
Model.obj (mathematical description)
Model.mtl (textual data) ------> ALL 4 ARE NEEDED FOR YOUR MODEL
Texture1.png
Texture1.png
Put all of the files in a Zipfile and upload to Sketchfab, if you want the public to be able to see your model
SG: NB it may be that your model is too big for github. In which case, get a sketchfab account and upload it there. Use ‘hist3812’ as a tag, too, and make sure the model is downloadable.

Computational Creativity and the Ontological Meaning of Your Models
 
	•	Can computers be creative?
	•	Computational Creativity is the study and simulation, by computational means, of behaviour, natural and artificial, which would, if observed in humans, be deemed creative
	•	Code simulation (neural networks) for creation from a computer to make something, like music
	•	Listen to Wikipedia, sounds based on new things and changes happening on Wikipedia
	•	Good Questions to ask:
	•	What are these things? Why are they the way they are? How did they get this way? What do they mean? And what do these answers imply for us history types?
	•	What we need, is a framework
 
	•	Entanglement: the way that an object has associations and entangled lines of being with other things
	•	I.e. iDevices entangled with the working conditions of those who made them - map these entanglements and see how they affect how we tell history, etc.
	•	Never a neutral way of using technology, only a mindful way
	•	Transformation of one kind of data or information to something else
	•	Ontological framework: bounded spaces - contain different histories that are equally true 
	•	Evidence of absences - things that don't physically exist, but are still meaningful, which only exist of a bounded object/space
	•	The 'archaeological record' is shaped by forces of persistency and permeability
	•	The Archaeological Record is not so much the product of data collection but the deployment of interventions or material interactions in which tool sand procedures are mobilized to materialize new entities
	•	Permeability vs. persistence (forces defining the qualities of the object)
	•	Enchainment vs. containment (forces defining the processes of assembly/disassembly)
 
MOUNT VESUSIUS
CE 79, Mount Vesuvius erupts, 4 sequences of collapses and the 4th reached Pompei
Thermal waves will kill you immediately, but it also makes your muscles contort
Site buried under several meters of ash
 
Tunnelling is easier than excavating - tunnel until find something cool and then dig it up and drag it out
 
Find voids - fill with plaster and remove rock - get casts of furniture - they discover the voids in which a body was once encompassed before it disintegrated
These first casts were very fragile - we are now making casts of casts, and each time we make a cast, something is lost
 
3D photogrammetry enters the scene and create pseudomorphs (expressed in the material of something else)
 
How do we understand the bodies of Pompeii, which are found as voids? Is a cast/pseudomorph a human body?

Quote from this (^) article, “The kids were the most forthcoming. Many of them rushed up to her, then uttered some variant of "Oooh, uggh! Is that a real Roman?" Their mums and dads tended to improvise one of two fairly predictable responses: "Yes dear, it is, but don't worry - she died a very long time ago"or "No, don't be silly, it's just a model" In an odd way, both those answers turn out to be right.”
 

Forces of things that exist

Permeability vs. persistence (forces defining the qualities of the object - resistance to change)
The biography of a victim of the pyroclastic surge - about the quality of the object
	•	The day before eruption: real human being, with loved ones, vices, etc.
	•	Eruption happens: the body does not persist very long (is permeable)
	•	The body decomposes and the stone hardens (which is still permeable, but persists for 2 thousand years) - all that is left is the imprint of the body in the rock
	•	Void and imprint are different
	•	Fill void with clay and break the stone away
	•	Gets these casts - skeuomorphs - simultaneously from the past and from the present
	•	Have to make molds because they decay - make in new kinds of materials
	•	Start making 3D models and 3D print those models pseudomorphs - digital form is still permeable (think digital remixes or iOs updates that don’t allow you to access anymore) 

 

When we do archaeology, we are intervening in the things
Enchainment vs. containment (forces defining the processes of assembly/disassembly - how it travels)
 
 
So what does this have to do with computational creativity?
	•	Computer is a prosthesis for thought
	•	Humanity is not a standard to which we should compare computers and computational creativity
	•	Think about the edges - of different steps, time, space, and how they smear against each other
	•	Computation creativity forces us to see things not as bounded but as blurred
	•	We don’t know what creativity is in humans, so how can we know what it is in computers?
	•	History asks why. To be able to ask why about these digital things means that we must be able to see the framework. 
What is the ontological meaning of your projects?
	•	Where is the creativity in your models?
	•	How do your models fit on these frameworks? Why?
	•	What do you see when you try to map the moments, the glitches, the voids and spaces?
