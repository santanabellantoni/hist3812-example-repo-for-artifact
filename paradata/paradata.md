# paradata - camera 



Macro Paradata: the big decisions relating to the nature of the visualisation.

Q: Why has the resource being created and for what audience?

A: This resource has been created so that other people can experience this digital artifact instead of viewing a 2D image.

Q: How will the resource be put to use? Is it sustainable and accessible?

A: It will have public access online for people to view it. It is sustainable at this level, but I would prefer a high quality 3D image. 

Q: Why have you chosen to use the approach/methods applied?

A: Using basic technology on my phone and websites like GitHub and Sketchfab, I can produce what seems to be a complicaated product with the use of accessible technology. 


Micro Paradata: the small-scale decision-making processes underlying the construction of the visualisation.

Q: What are the basic steps you followed in putting together the resource?

A: I used the app Trnio to create the 3D model of the camera. I researched online to find more information about the camera. 

Q: What supporting evidence did you rely upon?

A: The technology and research of my artifact. 

Q: How have you acknowledged uncertainty in the resource? Where might alternative interpretations have been made or where are such interpretations otherwise available for viewing audiences to refer to?

A: I think the app Trnio, still seems like it is under development. Looking back I would probably used something different to create my model. The way I see an audience interpreting the work I have produced thus far is that everything is still in development and the process is only at the beginning stages.
