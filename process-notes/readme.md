# readme - camera

When I began the process by choosing what object I wanted to turn into a 3D model I knew I didn't want to choose something too big.
I also wanted to choose something that has historical value. Instead of going to a museum and choosing an object I wouldn't be able to touch. I looked at some of the old cameras I own. A disposable, a polaroid, a minolta and the one i ended up choosing, a vintage Kodalk folding camera. I used the app Trnio to take the pictures that developed a model. It took 13 pictures to develop the view. My only complaints are that I should have used an all white background when I took the pictures, and that the time to process the model was over an hour long. I didn't think that 13 pictures strewn together would take as long as it did. I decided to publish a Hi-Res version, and I think that is what made it take so long to process. The model is a little bit blurry, and some of the details I can see in person are not visible in the model. There are some holes to the image and I may have to re-try making a new one with the app. Trnio was a bit confusing at first because I couldn't figure out how to publish and download the model. Since the app links to Sketchfab, I created an account and was able to uplaod it there.
